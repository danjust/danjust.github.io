I am Daniel, a machine learning research scientist at Graphcore in London, UK. I am excited about everything that makes Deep Learning more efficient. My research focusses on natural language processing (NLP) and graph representation learning.

When I'm not thinking about machine learning I enjoy hiking, cycling, skiing and above all helping my son explore the big, wide world :-)
